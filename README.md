# LogisticRegression
A simple logistic regression implemented on the iris dataset
Using the iris dataset we do a simple standardization and then split into training and testing. 
Since we are using logistic regression we make use of 'one-vs-rest' system in order for it to work. 
We are able to get a 91% accurate prediction rate using this model.
